# arduRocket

This repository contains code for the several parts of the ArduRocket project. The main idea of the project is the development of different small rockets components in order to have automatic control and deployment, telemetry and remote monitoring, and automatic video tracking. Most of the parts are really long shots for small scale rockets, but it can be accomplished with cheap parts and components, at least those which are available to amateur rocketist.

The organisation of the repository is by using folders for the different subprojects. So expects that this repository will be growing along time.
